# PoolPal
Prototype 2018
Pool Pal is a community app meant to help college and university students in particular. 
It allows students to place requests for things they might need and displays these notifications to the people going into town already. It manages payments and allows cab pooling as well.
The front end is scripted in react while the backend is node js(express).
